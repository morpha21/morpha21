Well, I have a Mathematics Bachelor's Degree, I'm interested in Data Science and Data Analisys, Machine Learning, Image Processing and Computer Vision, and Cryptography but all of that is new to me. I'm currently learning some image processing algorithms and implementing them in Go, and most recently, I've been studying Neural Networks, which should appear around here soon.
