Well, I have a Mathematics Bachelor's Degree, I'm interested in Data Science and Data Analisys, Machine Learning, Image Processing and Computer Vision, and Cryptography but all of that is new to me. I'm always trying to learn something new, and eventually I post here things I do that I consider interesting. Feel free to contact me if you spot any bug, have any suggestion to make, want to teach me something or if you think you could learn something from me aswel. And, of course, if you want to do any kind of colaboration.
