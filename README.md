Well, I have a bachelor's degree in Mathematics, and I'm currently learning how to code in both Java and Python.
I'm also really interested in Machine Learning, so I try to study some of this too. 
I hope soon I'll be able to focus more and more of my time in Machine Learning, 
creating some interesting projects and eventually getting a Machine Learning related job.
