Here I upload my studies and personal projects.

I do like Go, Python, Math, image processing (see the ```impala``` reository), scripting and automating stuff. I'm currently studying Machine Learning, so it should appear around here soon, implemented in Go 'from scratch' (see the ```Neural-Network``` repository) or maybe at a Jupyter Notebook.
