Hey there! Welcome.
I hope you're having a nice day. 

# about me
Above all, I'm a lifelong learner. Holding a bachelor's degree in mathematics, I'm a data analyst and a programmer who's always learning something new and enhancing my skills in areas I'm already familiar with. I like data engineering, data science, quantitative finance, data visualization, Linux, scripting, automation and programming in general. 

I'm always trying to automate everything that I feel is worth it, making my code cleaner and improving code performance through logic, concurrency or multi-threading.

# what skills do I have? 
I manipulate any kind of data with ease using **Python** or **SQL**, I have a solid understanding of Python's libraries most commonly used in data analysis, such as **Pandas**, **NumPy**, **Matplotlib**, **Seaborn** and **Plotly**. I can write code in **Go**, **Python**, **Java**, **Bash**, **Powershell** and any other programming language if I understand the tasks that I need to do and if it is given enough time. I understand **Machine Learning** algorithms, such as **linear regression**, **logistic regression**, **K-means clustering** and **KNN**. I have a pretty broad understanding of **Linux** operating systems and **Docker** containers.

# what will you find here?    
Well, here I upload my personal projects, personal scripts and some studies. You'll find Python and Go code, Jupyter Notebooks, many small Bash scripts, maybe a few Powershell, Go and Python scripts too.

 There is `impala`, a Go CLI tool that process images (having algorithms such as error diffusion dithering and some kernel convolutions like blur or sharpen). There is `NeuralNetwork`, a simple dense neural network I built in Go. There is `finance_stuff`, a collection of notebooks with analyses and visualizations of financial data such as stocks' prices, and some simulations of financial evolution. And there is `morphasCG`, a data engineering project I'm currently working on, where I'm trying to build a data pipeline and implement DevOps practices - I'm trying to learn both at once as I go. 

# what do I want to learn and may appear here in the future? 
This is hard to say. Projects involving all of the cited above are the most probable bet, but I'm also interested in computer networking and container orchestration.
